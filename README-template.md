## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Generate a password based on the selected inclusion options
- Copy the generated password to the computer's clipboard
- See a strength rating for their generated password
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Utility Classes
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I wanted to take a second and talk about a semicolon error.

```css
.fs-600 { font-size: var(--fs-600) };
.fs-500 { font-size: var(--fs-500) };
.fs-400 { font-size: var(--fs-400) };
```

should have been

```css
.fs-600 { font-size: var(--fs-600); }
.fs-500 { font-size: var(--fs-500); }
.fs-400 { font-size: var(--fs-400); }
```

took three days to figure it out.
Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

- [Pure CSS Custom Styled Radio Buttons](https://moderncss.dev/pure-css-custom-styled-radio-buttons/) - This article helped remind me how to style radio inputs, something I haven't done in quite a while.
- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/fighting-the-space-between-inline-block-elements/) - helpful for all things CSS, for this project I needed a reminder that space between inline block elements in HTML is rendered in the browser.
